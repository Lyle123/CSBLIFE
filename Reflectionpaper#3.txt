Reflection on Karilyo

1. What can you do to prevent what happened in the 2nd part of the story?
Like anybody would do, be eco friendly. Some of the people may not see it but being eco friendly is a great to way to save
our country. An exmaple of being eco friendly is to keep the environment as green as possible. Even if your gonna build a 
city, you should have at least reserve a place for animals to live in. For short, make the city as small as possible. 
So that you could at least save a few forest.

2. How does it affect you as a part of the Lasallian community?
It affect me in a way to be more serious Lasallian student meaning, start being eco friendly and start joining community
services like planting trees and the likes. It opened my eyes on what is a Lasallian student should be.

3. Give at least 2 Benildean core values shown on the production
Social responsibility and sense of nationhood. Those values were obviously shown in the production espcially to the 2nd part
of the story were the animals were hiding due to the pollution of our world. So having a social responsibility can prevent
that. As for sense of nation, you sense that you'll need to respect and cherish our world not abuse it.

4. How can you share these values to others?
I'll invite them to join some community services with me. It can already be a social responsibilty they won't even realize
it. The sense of nation hood? Maybe invite them to join NSTP because NSTP is serving the people of our country. There's 
already a sense of nationhood happening there.

5. Give your personal insights about the about the play
The play is showing us that we must act now to save our world before it's too late. It shows us the possibilities that
might occured if we don't act now.

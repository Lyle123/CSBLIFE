How can I apply Wozniak's system for myself and for this course?

Since Wozniak's system is all about how to learn, remember, and understand anything in the most effective way.
It can really apply for me and for my course, since I'm gonna learn and memorize a lot of codes like codes in BASIC, Pascal
Java, Ruby, Python, C, and C++

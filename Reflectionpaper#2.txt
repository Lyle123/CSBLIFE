Reflection on the Frosh orientation

It was pretty a nice orientation because it was the day that we fianlly got to know, what's the school all about.
For instance the schools purpose and quality. So yeah, it was a fun day. The games were not really that great but at least
it opened doors for us blockmates, because at first I was planning to stay quiet for the whole day but when the activites/
games took place. It helped me in a way to talk to almost everyone in the room. The tour around school was great because
the orientators were very professional at explaining the places, usage, purpose and such. The orientators pretty much explained
what's the school all about, like the rules, the proper way to approach a Deaf person, the importance of the school I.D,
flowchart, blue form and the schedule. The orientators were all friendly and approachable in every way so that was nice
All in all the orientation was a long tiring but worth it day.

Reflection on the Star/Shadow Recital

1. What Benildean core values have you learned for the STAR Reciatal 2011 performances?
The creativity and being professionally competence because as I watch them perform such awe strucking performances like
the shadow play and the acting parts. They really gave it their all professionally, they didn't flop a thing. The shadow
play was really creative and pleasing to the eyes.

2. What scene/production did you like most?
The 2 kids acting on stage becasue they were very good at their grammar and accents. And their voice were really audible
friendly. It was not weak at the same time not so loud.

3. How does it affect you you as a Benildean-Lasallian?
It affect me in a way to work harder and become more productive because when found out that they went through all that in
a matter of 6 weeks. I was like, "You can that within 6 weeks?!" Then if I do something in 6 weeks also. Maybe I can also
make a big difference to myself or produce an outstanding creation.

4. Among the core values, what struck you the most based from the production you watched?
The shadow play because it was really artistic and well played. The explanation of each shadow scene were understandable.
The shadows looked great and unique. The people using the shadows were very good and accurate on what they were doing.

5. Give a short reflection from the production that you have seen
All in all their performances were really professionally great, even though they are still under training. They performed as
if they were not college students anymore. The production was well played. The swtich between the next scene were very 
accurate. It was a bit boring but the lesson was worth it. And all of the cast member really did their part as if it was easy
which is great of course. It made them looked really ready and prepared.

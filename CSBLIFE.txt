<p style="font-size:15;color:maroon">My name is Lorenzo Lyle G, Abadia. Before my role in life was just being a kid and having fun but know everything change.

Since I started college, my role now is to became a responsible young adult cos in college we need that obviously.

So for that it also affected my routine cos back then whenever I got home from school. I just go to my room to relax or

go outside to hang with my friends, so of course I need to change that. In relationship, well all I can say is that I'm still 

adapting but so far it's great cos all of us in the class seems to always cooperate to one another, Which is important to

this course and I hope that there will be no bad blood between all of us. My expectations for myself is complete change cos

from the past years I haven't really took things seriously. So honestly, right know I'm having a hard time adapting to 

college life as for the expectations with my block mates. Well all I can say is unity, understanding, cooperation, and bonding.

I really hope that I can go through this and really make a name for myself in the world after this trial which is college.<HTML>

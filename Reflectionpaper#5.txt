Reflection on NSTP orientation

1. What is the aim of NSTP?
Their aim is to help and serve every people in the world who are in need of help and treatment. Taking care of the needy
people espcailly the unlucky ones. 

2. What are the three 3 program components of NSTP? Differentiate the three.
LTS - teaching the children in terms of mathematical abilities, writing and reading including moral values

CWTS - Is about doing charity works like donating, community services, and the likes.

ROTC - Is a military training that teaches you on how to wield a gun, discipline yourself, and how to be a soldier

3. What component program you intend to enrol? Why?
I intend to enrol CWTS because I always wanted to help to needy. Make them realize that the world is not really that unfair
I want to show them hope and the light of their lives. That God is always watching them no matter what. How? Well aiding
is already enough isn't it.

4. What is the role of NSTP in nation-building?
Their role to promote the youth to be a good civil/military leader by training them in every right way as possible

5. How will NSTP help you become good Filipino citizen and good Benildean-Lasallian?
It can make me a social resposible person. Which I can be already a good Filipino citizen and a good Benildean-Lasallian
student by having that value.

"That the novitate is made up of young men who have only recently left the world, who have not yet lost its spirit.
It would be dangerous for them to reenter the world so soon. Your parish is so near Paris that there are crowds of people
on the streets. There are some people who will make fun of the brothers, abuse them, and make them lose heart in their
vocation. These are the reasons why I asked permission to have this private chapel which seems to you to be against the
laws of the church" - St. John Baptist de La Salle

It seems that us humans needs something to believe in, cos without beliefs we will be scared or lost. Why? because if we
don't believe in anything well were just gonna be mindless people that keeps working for nothing but ourselves. Were gonna
ask ourselves someday that "Why are we living and what for?" were gonna feel that sense of lost if we don't believe in
something. Were also gonna be scared on something like for instance the afterlife; cos we don,t have a bit of idea about it
but if we believe on something like Religion for example, at least we know what's gonna be our faith after we die.
So basically having a belief is important in our life cos our hearts and minds needs it in terms of courage and knowledge.

This quote also tells me to always fight on what you believe in, just as long it can help others. Make sacrifices cos it
can help not only yourself but others as well. And always act based on what you believe in cos at least you feel that you
are right but of course be mindful of it firsthand... All in all be helpful to one another no matter what.

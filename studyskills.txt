1)Have you ever faild an exam? What were the reasons for failing?

Yes, I just rely on stock knowledge and I don't study seriously.

2)For those who haven't failed an exam what was your highest score in exam?

I'm not gonna answer this question because I failed some quizzes.

3)How was your first experience of CSB Midterm Examination? Knowing what you know, what would you you done differently?
What are you going to do again for the CSB finals?

It's nothing new really. The only different was, it has more items. I had actually studied for it so it became somewhat
an easy exam. Combining stock knowldege and reviewing can really be effective. I'm gonna study again of course, it is
the finals after all.
